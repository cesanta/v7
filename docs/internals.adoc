= V7 internals

V7 has four loosely coupled layers:

1. Tokenizer. Reads input source and returns next token.
2. Parser. Calls tokenizer to parse the source code, and builds an AST
3. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) - a representation of a program's syntax tree
   in portable binary form
4. Interpreter - an actual VM that executes AST

Each layer is described in a respective section below.


=== NaN packing

V7 uses well-known NaN packing technique for values. This is a method of
storing values in the IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point number.
`double` type is 64-bit, comprised of 1 sign bit, 11 exponent bits and
52 mantissa bits:

```
      7         6        5        4        3        2        1        0
  seeeeeee|eeeemmmm|mmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmm
```

If an exponent is all-1 and mantissa is non-0, then `double` value represents
NaN (not-a-number). V7 uses first 4 bits of mantissa to store value type,
and the rest 48 bits of mantissa goes to storing values:

```
  11111111|1111tttt|vvvvvvvv|vvvvvvvv|vvvvvvvv|vvvvvvvv|vvvvvvvv|vvvvvvvv
   NaN marker |type|  48-bit placeholder for values: pointers, strings
```

On 64-bit platforms, pointers occupy only 48 bits, so they can fit into the
48-bit placeholder - provided they are sign extended.

=== Strings

== Tokenizer

Tokenizer reads input source and returns next token. V7 uses hand-written
tokenizer. All possible tokens are described as `enum v7_tok`. Tokenizer
exports following interface:

=== `int skip_to_next_tok(const char **ptr);`

Move source code pointer `ptr` to the next token, skipping whitespaces
and comments. Return number of new lines skipped.

=== `enum v7_tok get_tok(const char **s, double *n, enum v7_tok prev_tok);`

Return a token pointed by source code pointer `s`. `get_tok()` expects
`skip_to_next_tok()` called, i.e. that `s` points to the valid next token.
If returned token is `TOK_NUMBER`, then `n` will contain parsed number.
`prev_tok` is required to parse RegExp literals, otherwise it would be
impossible to correctly parse strings like this: `a /= b; c /= d;`: when
tokenizer sees first `/`, it wouldn't know if it is a division or a
regexp literal.

`get_tok()` is basically a giant `switch` statement that looks at the first
character of the input string. For each letter, there is a short number of
tokens that begins with that letter, and `get_tok()` iterates over all of them.
Usually compilers generate jump table for the `switch` statement, which makes
`get_tok()` quite fast.


=== `int is_reserved_word_token(enum v7_tok tok);`

Return non-zero if the token is one of the reserved words. To make this
function fast, all reserved words tokens are grouped together in
alphabetical order, thus enabling this implementation:

```
int is_reserved_word_token(enum v7_tok tok) {
  return tok >= TOK_BREAK && tok <= TOK_WITH;
}
```

== Parser

V7 parser is a hand-written recursive-descent parser. It calls tokenizer
to get the next token in the stream, and generates an abstract syntax tree
(AST) that is represented as contiguous chunk of memory. All functions
that start with `parse_` prefix belong to parser.

== AST

AST represents program's syntax tree in portable binary form.
